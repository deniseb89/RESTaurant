It's the future! In the olden days... waitstaff needed to keep track of a party's order by hand!
A client has requested an application to help!
Here is what they wrote:
I want an application so our waitstaff can manage our food orders...

Overall... an employee should be able to...
  a: select a party of customers
  b: select food items the customers have ordered
  c: save a receipt

We'll keep thinking about it over the next few days and send more details when they come up.
